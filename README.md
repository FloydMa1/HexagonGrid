# Hexagon Grid

this is a small invention of making a hexagon grid in javascript.

## Features
These are some features in this artistic project

- [the makings of](https://github.com/FloydMa1/HexagonGrid/blob/master/sketch.js)

## Why not other Engines
Eventhough unity or unreal dont have the standard hexagon i chose for Html 5 because i already had learned so much the last period
about unity and unreal engine i wanted to explore html in different shapes and forms.

## Software Analysis 
my choice for this project was html 5 becouse i wanted to discover more about the possibilities of html and p5 javascript.
why i thought this was the best language to program in is because i didn't have much experience in p5 javascript with different shapes
so i got to learn more about processing and a little bit of the math that goes behind a hexagon.

## Learning Goals 
What i wanted to learn in this project
- Processiing
- A bit of math

## Planning 
This is my planning

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 |Think of the engine to make it in|make repos and begin the html and javascript|make the foundations of the html|Figure out the math behind hexagons|start making one hexagon|
|week 2 |make multiple hexagons|fit them next to each other|finish the project up|
